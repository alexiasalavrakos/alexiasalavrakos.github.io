I am a researcher currently working at [Quandela](https://www.quandela.com/) on photonic quantum computing and quantum machine learning.

I obtained my PhD at [ICFO](https://www.icfo.eu/) in the group of Antonio Ac√≠n, on the topic of [Bell inequalities for device-independent protocols](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/131434).

After my PhD and before joining Quandela, I worked as a data scientist in fintech for 3 years where I completed long-term projects on machine learning models for fraud detection and payment optimisation.

I was in the organising committee of the [YQIS conference](https://www.yqisconference.org/) in Barcelona in 2016, and I am currently in the YQIS steering committee (2023-present).

*Research interests: quantum foundations, Bell nonlocality, photonic quantum computing, quantum algorithms, quantum and classical machine learning.*
